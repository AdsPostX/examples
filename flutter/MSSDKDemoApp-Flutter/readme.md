**MomentScience** helps brands deliver the right offer at the right time, boosting conversion at key user journey moments.



## 📖 Overview

This demo app supports two integration modes that prefetch offers and display them instantly at checkout using a WebView.



## ⚙️ Integration Modes

### SDK Prefetch

* Offers are fetched and cached automatically via a hidden 0×0 WebView running in the background.
* Simplest integration path with no manual API calls.

### API Prefetch

* Offers are fetched manually via HTTPS requests.
* Pass the fetched offers response to the SDK at checkout.
* Provides full control over request timing and payload customization (e.g., user ID, cart value).

> In both modes, offers are rendered inside a WebView. If no offers are returned, the offer display screen can be skipped to ensure a smooth user experience.
